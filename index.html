            <p>Design combines analytics, logic, and artistry - it’s creativity with boundaries. I’m fascinated by the human mind, especially
                when it comes to interacting with technology. I love to understand what draws us in, what pushes us away, and what keeps us 
                coming back for more.<br>Although I love to make things aesthetically pleasing, I lean more towards UX than UI. I recently 
                started my design career, currently working on redesigning software development request forms for General Motors.<br>
                I like to leave things a little better than I found them, and aim to accomplish that with my design.
